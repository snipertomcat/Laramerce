This book is written at a relatively fast pace. It is intended for users who 
already know basic programming with php. It would also help enormously if you
knew a little about how HTTP works and the client/server architecture that is
the basis for making requests from the browser and receiving responses from 
the server. However, if you don't have a clue what I'm talking about I do 
provide a brief introduction to HTTP in the book (although I would suggest 
doing some more reading about this or any topic in this book you are uncomfortable and
unfamiliar with or are having a hard time grasping.) I provide some recommended
reading in the Appendix section of the book organized by topic so utilize these
resources as much as possible.

The goal of the book is to give you a general understanding of the Laravel 
framework.

A quick note... The idea behind this book is to teach you the basic use of the
Laravel framework by creating a very common application in today's world: An
E-Commerce Platform.
