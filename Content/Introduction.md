This book is written at a relatively fast pace. It is intended for users who already know basic programming with php. It would also help enormously if you knew  a little about how HTTP works and the client/server architecture that is the basis for making requests from the browser and receiving responses from the server. However, if you don't have a clue what I'm talking about I do provide a brief introduction to HTTP in the book (although I would suggest doing some more reading about any topic in this book you are uncomfortable and unfamiliar iwth or are having a hard time grasping.) I provide some recommended reading in the Appendix section of the book organized by topic so utilize these resources as much as possible.

The goal of the book is to give you a general understanding of the Laravel framework

That being said, ff

A quick note... The idea behind this book is to teach you the basic use of the Laravel framework by creating a very common application in today's world: An E-Commerce Platform. The spin on it is that I want you to learn al lthis in a weekend. Now, when I say weekend I mean a fully dedicated weekend. It is assumed you will put in 8 hours each day for 2 consecutive days. If you can't or won't meet this time constraint that's perfectly fine. Complete the book as you feel comfortable.
